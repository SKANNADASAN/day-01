HTTP 1.1

->HTTP 1.1 is the latest version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), 
the World Wide Web application protocol that runs on top of the Internet's
 TCP/IP suite of protocols. HTTP 1.1 provides faster delivery of Web pages 
 than the original HTTP and reduces Web traffic.

->It loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded,
    it blocks all the other resources behind it.

->Ithe usest works on the textual format.

->There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests 
    behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.

->It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages

->It compresses data by itself.

->HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 
 avoids network delay by using multiplexing



HTTP 2

->Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of standards allowing internet users
 to exchange website information. There have been four HTTP iterations since its 
 introduction in 1991. HTTP/2 was released in 2015 as a major revision to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

->It  is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at
 once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

->It works on the binary protocol.

->It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

->It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 

->	It uses HPACK for data compression.

->HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.
